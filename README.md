# Machine Learning (Coursera)
My coursera's course work on Machine Learning by Andrew NG, Stanford University.
This repository has solutions to all the weekly programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. The course provides a broad idea on various Machine learning algorithms. 
Please try to solving all the assignments by yourself first, but in case anyone would like have a quick reference, feel free to browse the code.
